## Our Activities

### Donation Drives
I organize small donation drives to collect funds, food, and supplies for local shelters and vet clinics. Your contributions and various others help provide the necessary resources for animals in need. These drives can be done in the form of various ways, such as going door to door for donations in exchange for hand crafted wood work pieces, or other items created to be exchanged for donations.

### Why?
When I was in 5th grade, I remembered hearing a faint meowing sound coming from my backyard but I disregarded it as nothing, but the next when I would wake up and head downstairs I would see a frozen kitten in my mothers hands. After that incident I got more involved in helping outdoor animals just by placing little shelters in the winter time. From then till now, me and my mother who helped Ohlone Humane Society with TNRs and more, have rescued over a dozen cats. 

### Awareness Campaigns
We believe in educating the community about animal welfare. Through social media campaigns, informational events, we spread awareness and encourage responsible pet ownership.
